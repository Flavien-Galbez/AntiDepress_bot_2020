Anti Depress Bot : Boty The kind robot

Project by : Youenn FRIN--SIMON & Flavien GALBEZ

The aim of this bot is to to prevent deprime (he can't do nothing for a person in
a deep state of depression).

He have muliple functionality :
- He can make joke thanks to the Joke API, they are uptadate everyday (and more for not free version) and classified by types
- He can also autogenerate answers with the nltk library (natural language tool kit), from citation of different website (in
our chatbo we used only one site but we can add some site in order to make the bot more smarter !)
- He takes care of the subject and we learned to the bot Trigering word in case of decision of suicide (he say to call an
help number)

You can find two file .py in the zip
- "app.py" is our final chatbot, he was made for work with facebook messenger using ngrok and flask
(he worked, however we have some issue after the first try, Facebook and ngrok stop to communicate and refuse to communicate again)
- "antidepressbot.py" was our intermediate chatbot with print on the consl python, however we give you that code to test him and
it was from its that we made the screenshot in the .zip)

The screenshot ilustrates the different capacity and functionality of our bot.
It was made one the intermediate chatbot cause we didn't capture the first try of our bot on Messenger (and we delet and recreate him
in order to solve the problem (spoiler: it didn't solve the problem), and we forgot to screenshot before :( (Yes, it was a bit stupid))).
